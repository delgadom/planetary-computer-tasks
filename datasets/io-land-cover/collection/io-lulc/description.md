__Note__: _A new version of this item is available for your use. This mature version of the map remains available for use in existing applications. This item will be retired in December 2024. There is 2020 data available in the newer [9-class dataset](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/io-lulc-9-class)._

Global estimates of 10-class land use/land cover (LULC) for 2020, derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution.  This dataset was generated by [Impact Observatory](http://impactobservatory.com/), who used billions of human-labeled pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning model for land classification.  The global map was produced by applying this model to the relevant yearly Sentinel-2 scenes on the Planetary Computer.

This dataset is also available on the [ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcover/).
