The [NOAA U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00332) consists of four climate variables derived from the [Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily) dataset: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, and precipitation. The data are provided in 1/24 degree lat/lon (nominal 5x5 kilometer) grids for the Continental United States (CONUS). 

On an annual basis, approximately one year of "final" NClimGrid data is submitted to replace the initially supplied "preliminary" data for the same time period. Users should be sure to ascertain which level of data is required for their research.

NClimGrid data is available in monthly and daily temporal intervals. Monthly data is available from 1895 to the present; daily data is available from 1951 to the present. This dataset is the **monthly** data. See the journal publication ["Improved Historical Temperature and Precipitation Time Series for U.S. Climate Divisions"](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/53/5/jamc-d-13-0248.1.xml) for more information about the monthly gridded data.
